# Remote architecture

Each connection joins a client to one environment over HTTP and WebSocket. The
environment owns providers, execution, files, and durable state. Direct access,
Tailscale, SSH, and T3 Connect change how the client reaches that server; they do
not introduce another execution model. See
[remote access](../user/remote-access.md) for setup.

## Identity is independent of the route

An environment keeps its ID across server restarts and endpoint changes. Saved
connections are local to a client profile; the server's identity and state are
not. A repository identity can correlate clones across environments, but never
routes work between them. A project and its threads belong to one environment.

[Environment ID initialization](../../apps/server/src/environment/ServerEnvironment.ts)
must publish a complete ID atomically. Repair of an empty ID file retains a
recovery file so concurrent or delayed initializers choose the same winner.
Removing that recovery state as ordinary temporary-file cleanup can change the
identity underneath an already-running server.

Advertised endpoints are reachability hints. Only the connecting device can
prove that a route works. In particular, a host's loopback address refers to a
different machine when another device opens it. Endpoint selection must not
silently fall back to loopback when a shareable endpoint is unavailable.

## Hosted web is a client

The hosted web app stores its connection catalog in the browser and connects
directly to each environment. It does not proxy traffic or hold server-side
pairing state. Hosting the UI over HTTPS therefore cannot make a plain HTTP LAN
backend accessible from that browser context.

A [hosted pairing URL](../../apps/web/src/hostedPairing.ts) identifies the backend
in its query and carries the pairing secret in its fragment. Fragments stay out
of requests to the hosted origin. The browser exchanges the secret with the
environment and strips it from its history. Moving the token into a query
parameter would disclose it to the wrong origin.

## Access and process ownership are different

Tailscale supplies an endpoint for ordinary pairing, so it needs no separate
environment type. Authentication remains the environment's responsibility for
every route. See [environment authentication](./environment-auth.md) and the
[T3 Connect trust boundary](./t3-connect.md).

SSH can launch a server as well as forward a port. Desktop main owns that
lifecycle because it can spawn SSH and handle authentication prompts. The
renderer uses the forwarded endpoint through the shared connection runtime.
[SSH cleanup](../../packages/ssh/src/tunnel.ts) stops a remote server only if the
launcher owns it; a server it discovered already running must survive a client
disconnect. Reconnection restores the forward before opening the application
transport.

Remote servers can outlive several client releases. Clients must use advertised
capabilities and handle their absence, rather than assume their own version
describes the server. Process replacement belongs to the launcher's
[update protocol](./server-updates.md); the connection runtime handles the
resulting disconnect.

### Sandboxes

A host environment can create sandboxes: Docker containers that each run their
own T3 server, so a paired client sees a complete environment. The
[sandbox service](../../apps/server/src/sandbox/SandboxService.ts) only creates,
starts, stops, removes, and mints pairing credentials; it never runs work inside
one. Docker is the record: containers carry `t3code.sandbox.*` labels and are
read back with `docker inspect`, so there is no sandbox table to drift.

The product calls them cubes (UI copy, errors, `t3 cube`). Code, contracts, RPC
methods, settings keys, and container labels keep `sandbox`, so renaming the
product term never touches the wire or stored state.

Clients connect to a sandbox directly, at `sandboxPublishHost` (loopback by
default, so only clients on the host machine). Docker assigns a new port each
time a sandbox starts, so a client cannot keep a sandbox's address. Instead each
client re-resolves its sandboxes from the host:
[`syncSandboxEnvironments`](../../packages/client-runtime/src/state/sandbox.ts)
registers ones it has not seen and moves saved ones to their current port,
keyed by the sandbox's environment ID, which survives restarts. A published
container port also crosses Docker's NAT and the host firewall, which host
networking does not; a firewall that filters forwarded traffic makes a LAN or
tailnet publish address unreachable even though the host itself answers there.
Sandboxes are off by default because access to the Docker daemon is effectively
root on the host.

### Desktop without a local environment

Desktop normally launches its own primary server, but the desktop setting `localEnvironmentEnabled`
(`apps/desktop/src/settings/DesktopAppSettings.ts`) turns that off. Changing it relaunches the app;
no local state is deleted. On the next start the main process skips port selection, server exposure,
and the primary and WSL backends, and opens the window right away. The renderer sees this through
`desktopBridge.getLocalEnvironmentEnabled()`: `readPrimaryEnvironmentTarget` returns null, so primary
auth and platform-managed discovery are skipped and only saved environments (pairing, relay, SSH)
connect. This is possible because the desktop renderer is not served by the backend: the `t3code://`
scheme serves the bundled client from disk (Vite in development) and API traffic always goes to the
environment's own URL.
